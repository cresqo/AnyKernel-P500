-How to use it?
After clone into the git, you will have 3 folders:
META-INF/ - dont' change anything in there!
kernel/ - don't change anything in there, put your kernel with the original zImage!
system/lib/modules - put kernel modules into there. delete tiwlan_drv.ko first!
-What to do next?
Compress 3 folders.
-And then?
You should sign the zip by using the dsixda kitchen or Some APK Signer software OR Android SDK tools signapk.jar.
