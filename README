-How to use it?
After clone into git, you will have 3 folders:
META-INF/ 	   - dont' change anything in there!
kernel/   	   - don't delete files in there, just replace your "zImage" file with the "zImage" in this folder!
system/lib/modules - First, Delete all files and then grab your kernel modules into here!

-And then?
